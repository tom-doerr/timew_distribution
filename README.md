This plugin plots the time you spent on a tag as a histogram.
The location of the last item you tracked is marked with a red square in the plot.

Instead of typing `timew distribution ...` you can also type `timew dist ...` or `timew dis ...`.


## Installation
Install the `termplotlib` library using
```
pip3 install termplotlib
```

Then you just need to copy the file `distribution.py` into your timewarrior extension folder.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tom-doerr/timew_distribution.git
cp timew_distribution/distribution.py ~/.timewarrior/extensions/
```
